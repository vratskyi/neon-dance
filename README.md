# Neon Dance - Free Portfolio Website ðŸ˜ŽðŸ”¥

### Hi everyone! I am happy to show you my first open source project on github.

It is created in the style of Neon Cyberpunk, (*was inspired by cyberpunk 2077*), in general I hope someone will like this project, and on its basis you can create something of your own.

# Road Map

These are the goals that are very important at the moment, when they will be fulfilled of course there will be others.

> - [ ]  **Optimization** - Code optimization, reworking the use of Vue.JS methods, bug fixes.
> - [ ]  **Decomposition** - Separation of reusable elements into components
> - [ ]  **[Strapi](https://strapi.io/)** - Integration with Strapi CMS, easy management of site content, without the 					need for knowledge of the code.
